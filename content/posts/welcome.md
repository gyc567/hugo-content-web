## Getting Started

### 1. Basic Configuration

Edit your `hugo.toml` file to customize your site:

```toml
baseURL = "https://your-domain.com"
title = "Your Site Title"

[params]
  description = "Your site description"
  author = "Your Name"
  monetag_site_id = "YOUR_MONETAG_SITE_ID"
```

### 2. Creating Content

Create new posts in the `content/posts/` directory:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

### 3. Customizing the Theme

The theme files are located in `themes/custom-theme/`. You can modify:

- **Layouts**: `layouts/` directory
- **Styles**: `static/css/main.css`
- **Scripts**: `static/js/` directory
- **Partials**: `layouts/partials/` directory

### 4. Monetag Setup

To enable Monetag ads:

1. Sign up at [Monetag](https://monetag.com)
2. Get your site ID
3. Update `monetag_site_id` in your `hugo.toml`
4. Set `monetag_enabled = true`

## Advanced Features

### Search Configuration

The search functionality is powered by a JSON index generated at build time. You can customize search behavior by modifying:

- `layouts/index.json` - Search index structure
- `static/js/search.js` - Search logic and UI
- `layouts/search/search.html` - Search page template

### Like System Customization

The like system stores data locally but can be extended to use a backend API:

```javascript
// Example: Switch to API-based storage
window.likesManager.storage = {
    getItem: (key) => fetch(`/api/storage/${key}`),
    setItem: (key, value) => fetch(`/api/storage/${key}`, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(value)
    })
};
```
